Whispers of Code

"In the quiet hum of backend’s might,
Servers weave through day and night.
Data flows in streams unseen,
Guarding realms where bits convene.

Svelte emerges, sleek and bright,
Painting views with pure delight.
Reactive whispers, swift and clear,
Crafting interfaces we revere.

Together they dance, a seamless blend,
Where sturdy foundations meet trends that bend.
Backend’s strength and Svelte’s finesse,
Creating worlds of progress.

In every line and every thread,
Their synergy is softly spread.
A digital duet, bold and true,
Building dreams in code’s hue."
