# Canvas Animation System - Universal Implementation Plan
[Previous content remains unchanged...]

## Implementation Overview & Issues (June 2025)

### Completed Features
1. **Animation Engine Implementation**
   - Created `AnimationEngine.ts` with frame preloading and state management
   - Implemented memory-efficient frame loading with proper cleanup
   - Added support for multiple trigger modes (auto, hover, click)

2. **Component Development**
   - Built `CanvasAnimation.svelte` with responsive design
   - Implemented proper TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Added support for fallback content and loading states

3. **Accessibility Features**
   - Implemented reduced motion detection
   - Added ARIA labels for screen readers
   - Created fallback content slots

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **File Naming Convention**
   - **Issue**: Initial implementation used 4-digit frame numbers (0001.webp)
   - **Solution**: Updated to 5-digit format (00000.webp) to match existing assets
   - **Impact**: Required adjustment to frame number padding in AnimationEngine

2. **CSS Compatibility**
   - **Issue**: Browser warnings about non-standard CSS properties
   - **Solution**: Added proper vendor prefixes for text-size-adjust
   - **Note**: Some warnings (content-stretch) from Svelte internal handling remain but don't affect functionality

3. **State Management**
   - **Issue**: Complex state handling between engine and component
   - **Solution**: Implemented AnimationState interface with proper TypeScript types
   - **Benefit**: Better type safety and clearer state transitions

4. **Resource Management**
   - **Issue**: Potential memory leaks from canvas and event listeners
   - **Solution**: Implemented proper cleanup in onDestroy
   - **Details**: Added ResizeObserver cleanup and event listener removal

### Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Phase 2 implementations
2. Implement advanced loading strategies from Phase 3
3. Add performance monitoring and optimization
4. Create comprehensive documentation

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the animation system while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
