# Security Checklist for Chat Logging Implementation

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security validation for the chat logging system  
**Run**: Before production deployment and monthly thereafter

## üîê Environment Security

### Environment Variables
- [ ] `USER_ID_SALT` is cryptographically secure (32+ characters, hex)
- [ ] `USER_ID_SALT` is different across environments (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] `ENABLE_CHAT_LOGGING` properly controls feature activation
- [ ] No sensitive values hardcoded in source code
- [ ] Environment variables not logged in application output

### Access Control
- [ ] Admin API endpoints require authentication
- [ ] No admin endpoints exposed without protection
- [ ] API keys stored securely in environment (not in code)
- [ ] Different API keys for different environments

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection

### User Identification
- [ ] IP addresses never stored directly
- [ ] User identifiers properly salted and hashed
- [ ] Hash function is cryptographically secure (SHA-256)
- [ ] Salt is unique per application instance
- [ ] No way to reverse-engineer IP from stored hash

**Test with:**
```bash
# Verify same IP+UA produces same hash consistently
curl -X POST /api/chat/session/start -d '{"sessionToken":"test1","userAgent":"test","deviceType":"desktop"}'
curl -X POST /api/chat/session/start -d '{"sessionToken":"test2","userAgent":"test","deviceType":"desktop"}'
# Check database - should have same user_identifier
```

### Content Security
- [ ] Message content stored as-is (no additional encryption needed for portfolio context)
- [ ] Embeddings cannot be reverse-engineered to original text
- [ ] No PII accidentally captured in referrer or user agent
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Database queries parameterized (no SQL injection risk)

### Data Retention
- [ ] Automatic cleanup working (6-month retention)
- [ ] Manual cleanup requires explicit confirmation
- [ ] Export functionality limits data exposure
- [ ] Deleted data is actually deleted (not just marked)

## üö® Input Validation

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Session tokens validated (format, length)
- [ ] Message content length limited (prevent DoS)
- [ ] Session token uniqueness enforced
- [ ] Invalid JSON handled gracefully
- [ ] Malformed requests don't crash server

**Test with:**
```bash
# Test malformed requests
curl -X POST /api/chat/session/start -d '{"invalid":"json'
curl -X POST /api/chat/session/start -d '{}'
curl -X POST /api/chat/message/log -d '{"sessionToken":"fake"}'

# Test oversized content
curl -X POST /api/chat/message/log -d '{
  "sessionToken":"test",
  "message":{"content":"'$(python -c 'print("A"*10000)')'"}
}'
```

### Database Security
- [ ] SQL injection tests pass
- [ ] Prepared statements used throughout
- [ ] Database permissions follow least privilege
- [ ] Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data
- [ ] Indexes don't leak sensitive information

**Test SQL injection attempts:**
```bash
# Test session token injection
curl -X POST /api/chat/session/start -d '{
  "sessionToken":"test\"; DROP TABLE chat_sessions; --",
  "userAgent":"test"
}'

# Test message content injection
curl -X POST /api/chat/message/log -d '{
  "sessionToken":"test",
  "message":{"content":"test\"; UPDATE chat_messages SET content=\\\"hacked\\\"; --"}
}'
```

## üîí Authentication & Authorization

### Admin Endpoints
- [ ] All admin endpoints protected
- [ ] Authentication method secure (API keys, not basic auth)
- [ ] No authentication bypass possible
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force
- [ ] Sessions timeout appropriately

**Test authentication bypass:**
```bash
# Try accessing without auth
curl /api/admin/chat/validate
curl /api/admin/chat/health

# Try with invalid auth
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid" /api/admin/chat/validate

# Try with common bypass attempts
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer admin" /api/admin/chat/validate
curl -H "X-Original-User: admin" /api/admin/chat/validate
```

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] CORS headers properly configured

- [ ] Right to access: Export API available
- [ ] Right to rectification: Manual deletion possible

### Anonymization Verification
- [ ] Stored data cannot identify individuals
- [ ] Cross-session correlation requires significant effort
- [ ] Export functions redact identifying information
- [ ] Analytics aggregation preserves anonymity
