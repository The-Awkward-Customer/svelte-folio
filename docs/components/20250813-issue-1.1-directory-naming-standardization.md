# Issue 1.1: Directory Naming Standardization

**Created:** 2025-08-13  
**Priority:** High  
**Confidence:** 90-100%  
**Phase:** Foundation Standardization

## Issue Description

Inconsistent directory naming conventions across the component system create confusion and maintenance overhead. Currently using a mix of kebab-case and camelCase conventions.

**Current State:**
- `top-nav/` (kebab-case)
- `accordionItems/` (camelCase)
- Most directories use kebab-case
- Inconsistency creates mental overhead

## Todo List

- [x] **Audit all directory names for consistency**
  - [x] List all current directory names and their conventions
  - [x] Identify directories that don't follow kebab-case
  - [x] Document current import paths that will be affected

- [x] **Rename non-conforming directories**
  - [x] Rename `accordionItems/` to `accordion-items/`
  - [x] Verify no other camelCase directories exist
  - [x] Use git mv to preserve history

- [x] **Update import paths**
  - [x] Search for all imports referencing renamed directories
  - [x] Update barrel export references
  - [x] Update component imports in consuming files

- [x] **Update barrel exports**
  - [x] Modify index.ts files to reflect new structure
  - [x] Verify all exports still function correctly
  - [x] Test barrel export resolution

- [x] **Verification**
  - [x] Run build to ensure no broken imports
  - [x] Test component functionality
  - [x] Update documentation references

## Decision Points & Questions

### 1. Naming Convention Choice
**Question:** Should we use kebab-case consistently for all directories?  
**Options:**
- A) Strict kebab-case for all directories ✅ **Recommended**
- B) kebab-case for top-level, camelCase for nested
- C) Current mixed approach

**Rationale:** Consistency improves developer experience and reduces cognitive load.

### 2. Migration Strategy
**Question:** Should we rename directories incrementally or all at once?  
**Considerations:**
- Git history preservation
- Team coordination
- Testing complexity

**Recommendation:** All at once to avoid prolonged inconsistency

### 3. Documentation Updates
**Question:** What documentation needs updating after renames?  
**Scope:**
- Component structure documentation
- Import examples in README
- Development guidelines

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- [x] All directories follow kebab-case convention
- [x] Zero broken import references
- [x] Build passes without warnings
- [x] All barrel exports function correctly
- [x] Git history preserved for renamed directories

### Secondary Success Metrics
- [x] Documentation updated to reflect new structure
- [ ] Developer team informed of changes
- [x] IDE autocomplete works with new paths
- [x] No performance regression in build times

## Action Confidence Rating: 95%

### High Confidence Factors
- **Clear scope:** Limited to directory renames and import updates
- **Mechanical changes:** Mostly find-and-replace operations
- **Low risk:** Changes are structural, not functional
- **Tooling support:** Git mv preserves history, IDEs help with refactoring

### Potential Challenges
- **Import discovery:** May miss some dynamic imports (5% risk)
- **Third-party references:** External tools pointing to old paths (3% risk)
- **Team coordination:** Ensuring all developers pull changes (2% risk)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- None identified for this specific change

### Medium Risk
- **Missed import references:** Some imports might be in config files or tests
- **External dependencies:** Third-party tools or documentation

### Low Risk
- **Build failures:** Easy to detect and fix
- **Developer confusion:** Temporary, resolved with communication

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Audit (Day 1)
1. List all current directory names
2. Identify non-kebab-case directories
3. Search codebase for affected import paths
4. Document findings

### Phase 2: Rename (Day 1-2)
1. Use `git mv` to rename directories
2. Update barrel exports immediately
3. Update import paths in batches
4. Test after each batch

### Phase 3: Verification (Day 2)
1. Run full build and test suite
2. Verify all components render correctly
3. Update documentation
4. Communicate changes to team

### Rollback Plan
- Keep backup branch before changes
- Git history allows easy reversion
- Import path changes are easily reversible

## Related Issues

- **Issue 1.2:** Footer structure consolidation (may create additional directories)
- **Issue 1.3:** Directory cleanup (may remove some directories)

## Implementation Results

### Completed Actions
1. **Directory Audit:** Identified only `accordionItems/` as non-kebab-case directory
2. **Rename Executed:** Successfully renamed to `accordion-items/` using `git mv`
3. **Import Analysis:** No direct imports found requiring updates
4. **Build Verification:** `npm run build` completed successfully with no errors
5. **Type Check:** `npm run check` passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings
6. **Documentation:** Updated `FRONT_END_PROJECT_REFERENCE.md`

### Time to Complete
**Actual Effort:** 1 hour (significantly less than estimated 4-6 hours)

### Breaking Changes
**Actual Impact:** None - no direct imports to the renamed directory were found
