# Issue 1.3: Directory Cleanup

**Created:** 2025-08-13  
**Priority:** High  
**Confidence:** 70-89%  
**Phase:** Foundation Standardization

## Issue Description

Several directories are incomplete, empty, or contain experimental components without proper organization, creating uncertainty about component status and cluttering the component structure.

**Current State:**
- Empty `/forms/` directory
- `/experimental/dialog/` components lack barrel exports
- Unclear status of experimental components
- No deprecation strategy for unused directories

## Todo List

- [ ] **Audit incomplete directories**
  - [ ] Evaluate `/forms/` directory purpose and contents
  - [ ] Document experimental component status and usage
  - [ ] Identify any other empty or placeholder directories
  - [ ] Check for orphaned or unused components

- [ ] **Forms directory decision**
  - [ ] Determine if forms functionality is needed
  - [ ] Either populate with form components or remove entirely
  - [ ] Document decision rationale
  - [ ] Update component roadmap if removing

- [ ] **Experimental component organization**
  - [ ] Add barrel exports to `/experimental/dialog/`
  - [ ] Document experimental component purpose
  - [ ] Create experimental component guidelines
  - [ ] Establish promotion/deprecation criteria

- [ ] **Create deprecation strategy**
  - [ ] Define component lifecycle stages
  - [ ] Create deprecation warning system
  - [ ] Establish timeline for experimental component decisions
  - [ ] Document experimental-to-stable promotion process

- [ ] **Directory structure cleanup**
  - [ ] Remove truly unused directories
  - [ ] Add README files for experimental areas
  - [ ] Update component inventory documentation
  - [ ] Verify all directories have clear purpose

## Decision Points & Questions

### 1. Forms Directory Strategy
**Question:** Should we populate or remove the forms directory?  
**Options:**
- A) Remove entirely - forms not needed in current scope
- B) Populate with basic form components
- C) Keep as placeholder for future development ✅ **Requires stakeholder input**

**Considerations:**
- Current application form requirements
- Future development plans
- Component library completeness

### 2. Experimental Component Strategy
**Question:** How should we handle experimental components?  
**Options:**
- A) Remove immediately if not used
- B) Deprecate with timeline ✅ **Recommended**
- C) Move to separate package
- D) Promote to stable if functional

**Rationale:** Deprecation allows for evaluation period and prevents accidental removal of valuable work.

### 3. Component Lifecycle Management
**Question:** What stages should components go through?  
**Proposed stages:**
- Experimental → Alpha → Beta → Stable → Deprecated → Removed

**Timeline:** 
- Experimental: No timeline limit
- Alpha: 2-4 weeks evaluation
- Beta: 4-8 weeks testing
- Deprecated: 8-12 weeks notice

### 4. Barrel Export Strategy for Experimental
**Question:** Should experimental components have barrel exports?  
**Considerations:**
- Makes imports cleaner
- Suggests stability/permanence
- Easier to track usage

**Recommendation:** Yes, but with clear experimental labeling

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- [ ] All directories have clear purpose and contents
- [ ] No empty or placeholder directories without justification
- [ ] Experimental components have proper organization
- [ ] Component lifecycle strategy documented
- [ ] All components have barrel exports where appropriate

### Secondary Success Metrics
- [ ] Developer confusion about component status eliminated
- [ ] Component discovery improved
- [ ] Future component development process clarified
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect clean structure

## Action Confidence Rating: 75%

### Medium Confidence Factors
- **Requires stakeholder input:** Forms directory decision needs product/design input
- **Subjective decisions:** What constitutes "experimental" vs "alpha"
- **Future planning:** Decisions affect long-term component strategy
- **Usage analysis needed:** Must determine if experimental components are used

### High Confidence Factors
- **Clear technical steps:** Adding barrel exports is straightforward
- **Documentation improvements:** Always beneficial
- **Structure cleanup:** Obvious improvements available

### Uncertainty Factors
- **Forms requirements:** Unknown if forms functionality needed (20% uncertainty)
- **Experimental usage:** Don't know if dialog components are actively used (15% uncertainty)
- **Stakeholder priorities:** Component library scope decisions (10% uncertainty)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Premature removal:** Deleting components that are actually needed
- **Breaking changes:** Removing imports that are used elsewhere

### Medium Risk
- **Decision paralysis:** Stakeholder input delays may stall progress
- **Scope creep:** Directory cleanup may reveal larger architectural issues

### Low Risk
- **Documentation updates:** Non-functional improvements
- **Barrel export additions:** Purely additive changes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis (Day 1)
1. Audit all directory contents and purposes
2. Search codebase for usage of experimental components
3. Identify stakeholders for forms directory decision
4. Document current component lifecycle (if any)

### Phase 2: Quick Wins (Day 1-2)
1. Add barrel exports to experimental components
2. Add README files for experimental directories
3. Remove clearly unused directories (after verification)
4. Update component inventory

### Phase 3: Stakeholder Decisions (Day 3-5)
1. Present forms directory options to stakeholders
2. Get decision on experimental component strategy
3. Implement decisions based on stakeholder input
4. Update documentation with new policies

### Phase 4: Implementation (Day 5-7)
1. Execute stakeholder decisions
2. Implement component lifecycle documentation
3. Clean up remaining directory issues
4. Verify all changes work correctly

### Rollback Plan
- Git history preserves any deleted components
- Barrel exports are purely additive
- Documentation changes are easily reversible
- Stakeholder decisions can be revised

## Related Issues

- **Issue 1.1:** Directory naming (may affect experimental directory names)
- **Issue 1.2:** Footer consolidation (part of broader cleanup)
- **Issue 3.1:** Component documentation (will help clarify component status)

## Stakeholder Input Required

### Forms Directory Decision
**Stakeholders:** Product Manager, Design Lead, Frontend Lead  
**Questions:**
- Are form components needed in current product scope?
- What form functionality is required?
- Timeline for form component development?

### Experimental Component Strategy
**Stakeholders:** Frontend Lead, Architecture Team  
**Questions:**
- How should experimental components be managed?
- What criteria determine promotion to stable?
- Should experimental components be user-facing?

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Begin directory audit and usage analysis
2. **Day 1:** Add barrel exports to experimental components
3. **Day 2:** Schedule stakeholder meetings for decisions
4. **Week 1:** Implement stakeholder decisions
5. **Week 2:** Monitor for any issues or missed components

**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours (including stakeholder coordination)  
**Breaking Changes:** Potential - depends on stakeholder decisions  
**Team Coordination Required:** High - requires stakeholder input
