# Character Grid Background Debug Plan

## Issue
The mouse hover gradient effect is not being triggered in the CharacterGridBackground canvas after abstracting mouse tracking to a global mouseManager.

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED** - The issue has been resolved by switching from `$state` to Svelte stores.

## Debug Process & Solution

### Root Cause Identified
The primary issue was **Svelte reactivity not working with `$state` accessed through getters**. The mouse manager was tracking mouse movement correctly, but Svelte's reactive statements weren't triggering when accessing the state through class getters.

### Debug Steps Completed

#### 1. Verify Mouse Manager State ✅
- [x] Mouse position logging works - ✅ Mouse events were firing
- [x] Mouse manager initializes properly - ✅ Initialization worked
- [x] Verify `isActive` state changes correctly - ❌ **This revealed the issue**
- [x] Check if mouse coordinates are in correct coordinate system - ❌ **Coordinates stuck at (0,0)**

#### 2. Discovered Reactivity Issue
**Problem**: Console showed:
- Mouse manager receiving events: `Mouse move: 672 472`
- Draw function seeing stale state: `mouse: (0,0), isActive: false`

#### 3. Attempted Solutions
1. **Lazy initialization** - Fixed SSR issues but didn't solve reactivity
2. **Direct state access** - Added `get state()` method but still no reactivity
3. **Improved reactive statements** - Changed from complex conditions to direct access

#### 4. Final Solution ✅
**Switched from `$state` class-based approach to Svelte writable store:**

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
class MouseManager {
  private _state = $state<MouseState>({ x: 0, y: 0, isActive: false });
  get x() { return this._state.x; }
  // Getters don't trigger Svelte reactivity properly
}
```

**After (Working):**
```typescript
const createMouseManager = () => {
  const { subscribe, update } = writable<MouseState>({ x: 0, y: 0, isActive: false });
  return { subscribe, init };
};
export const mouseManager = createMouseManager();
```

**Usage in component:**
```svelte
$: $mouseManager, ctx && draw(); // Direct store reactivity
const distance = $mouseManager.isActive ? Math.sqrt(...) : highlightDistance + 1;
```

## Key Learnings
1. **Svelte 5 `$state` gotcha**: Accessing `$state` through getters in classes breaks reactivity
2. **Stores still superior**: Traditional Svelte stores work more reliably for global state
3. **SSR considerations**: Both approaches needed proper window checks
4. **Debug technique**: Console logging revealed the reactivity gap between state updates and component re-renders

## Final Result
✅ Mouse hover gradient effect now works perfectly
✅ Characters brighten as mouse approaches  
✅ Smooth opacity transitions based on distance
✅ Global mouse tracking works from any page element
