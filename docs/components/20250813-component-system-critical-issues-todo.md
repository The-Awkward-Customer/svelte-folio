# Component System Critical Issues - Action Plan

**Created:** 2025-08-13  
**Priority:** High  
**Scope:** Design System Scalability Improvements

## Todo List

### Phase 1: Foundation Standardization (High Priority)

- [ ] **1.1** Audit all directory names for consistency
  - [ ] Rename `accordionItems/` to `accordion-items/`
  - [ ] Standardize all directories to kebab-case
  - [ ] Update all import paths affected by renames
  - [ ] Update barrel exports to reflect new structure

- [ ] **1.2** Consolidate footer structure inconsistencies
  - [ ] Remove empty `/footer/index.ts`
  - [ ] Ensure all footer components are in `/layout/footer/`
  - [ ] Update imports referencing footer components
  - [ ] Verify no broken references exist

- [ ] **1.3** Clean up incomplete directories
  - [ ] Evaluate `/forms/` directory - populate or remove
  - [ ] Add barrel exports to `/experimental/dialog/`
  - [ ] Document experimental component status
  - [ ] Create deprecation plan for unused directories

### Phase 2: Design Token Implementation (High Priority)

- [ ] **2.1** Create design token system
  - [ ] Design spacing token scale (--spc-*)
  - [ ] Design color token system (--color-*)
  - [ ] Design typography token system
  - [ ] Create token documentation

- [ ] **2.2** Implement token usage
  - [ ] Convert hardcoded values to tokens in primitives
  - [ ] Update action components to use tokens
  - [ ] Audit card components for token usage
  - [ ] Create token validation utilities

### Phase 3: Component API Standardization (Medium Priority)

- [ ] **3.1** Document component interfaces
  - [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for all props
  - [ ] Document event contracts
  - [ ] Create usage examples for each component
  - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all exports

- [ ] **3.2** Implement theming system
  - [ ] Create variant prop patterns
  - [ ] Implement theme context
  - [ ] Add dark/light mode support
  - [ ] Create theme switching utilities

### Phase 4: Architecture Improvements (Medium Priority)

- [ ] **4.1** Reduce directory complexity
  - [ ] Flatten `/overlays/dialog/` structure if possible
  - [ ] Consolidate similar components
  - [ ] Remove duplicate functionality
  - [ ] Optimize barrel export performance

- [ ] **4.2** Add composition patterns
  - [ ] Implement compound component patterns
  - [ ] Add slot-based composition
  - [ ] Create higher-order component utilities
  - [ ] Document composition guidelines

## Decision Points & Questions

### 1. Directory Naming Strategy
**Question:** Should we use kebab-case consistently or consider camelCase for nested contexts?  
**Options:**
- A) Strict kebab-case for all directories
- B) kebab-case for top-level, camelCase for nested
- C) Current mixed approach

**Recommendation:** Option A - consistency trumps context

### 2. Design Token Scope
**Question:** How granular should the token system be?  
**Considerations:**
- Performance impact of CSS custom properties
- Developer experience vs. flexibility
- Migration effort from current CSS

### 3. Component Deprecation Strategy
**Question:** How should we handle experimental and deprecated components?  
**Options:**
- A) Remove immediately
- B) Deprecate with timeline
- C) Move to separate package

### 4. Breaking Change Management
**Question:** Should we batch breaking changes or implement incrementally?  
**Impact:**
- Development velocity
- User experience
- Testing complexity

### 5. Theme System Architecture
**Question:** Should theming be CSS-based or JavaScript-based?  
**Considerations:**
- Runtime performance
- SSR compatibility
- Developer experience

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Metrics
- [ ] All directories follow consistent naming convention
- [ ] Zero broken import references
- [ ] All components have barrel exports
- [ ] No empty or placeholder directories
- [ ] Build passes without warnings

### Phase 2 Success Metrics
- [ ] Design token system covers 90% of current hardcoded values
- [ ] All primitive components use tokens exclusively
- [ ] Token documentation is complete and accessible
- [ ] Performance regression < 5% on component rendering

### Phase 3 Success Metrics
- [ ] All components have TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] 100% component documentation coverage
- [ ] Theme switching works across all components
- [ ] API consistency score > 90%

### Phase 4 Success Metrics
- [ ] Component discovery time reduced by 50%
- [ ] Composition patterns documented with examples
- [ ] Bundle size impact < 10% increase
- [ ] Developer satisfaction survey shows improvement

## Action Confidence Ratings

### High Confidence (90-100%)
- **1.1** Directory naming standardization - Well-defined scope, clear execution path
- **1.2** Footer structure consolidation - Small scope, minimal dependencies
- **2.1** Design token creation - Established patterns, clear benefits

### Medium Confidence (70-89%)
- **1.3** Directory cleanup - Requires stakeholder input on forms directory
- **2.2** Token implementation - May reveal edge cases in existing components
- **3.1** Component documentation - Time-intensive but straightforward

### Lower Confidence (50-69%)
- **3.2** Theming system - Complex architectural decisions required
- **4.1** Directory flattening - May impact existing mental models
- **4.2** Composition patterns - Requires design system expertise

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Breaking changes to import paths could impact entire application
- Design token migration might reveal inconsistencies in current design

### Medium Risk
- Performance implications of token system not fully known
- Theming system complexity could create maintenance burden

### Low Risk
- Documentation improvements have minimal implementation risk
- Directory cleanup is largely mechanical

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Begin Phase 1.1 directory naming audit
2. **Week 1:** Complete directory standardization
3. **Week 2:** Start design token system implementation
4. **Week 3:** Begin component API documentation
5. **Month 1 Review:** Assess progress and adjust timeline

**Note:** This plan should be reviewed and approved by the development team before implementation. Breaking changes require coordination with all stakeholders.
