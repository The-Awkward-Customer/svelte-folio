## Summary
Prepare the application for reliable deployment by wiring end-to-end CI/CD, auditing performance, adding monitoring/observability, and hardening the database layer. This phase ensures consistent build quality, operational visibility, and resilience in production.

## Motivation
- Enforce quality gates (lint, types, tests, E2E) on every change.
- Validate runtime performance and animation memory cleanup.
- Gain insight into errors and performance via monitoring.
- Improve data reliability with migrations and error handling.

## Scope
- In scope:
  - CI/CD: Jobs for lint, type-check, unit/component tests, Playwright E2E with trace.
  - Performance: Lighthouse/CWV checks; address findings; verify animation cleanup.
  - Monitoring: Error tracking and performance monitoring integration.
  - Database: Migrations, error handling strategy; add pooling if warranted.
- Out of scope:
  - Large-scale feature work; focus remains on operational readiness.

## Impact
- Code/Config: CI workflows, Playwright configs, monitoring SDK initialization.
- Runtime: Potentially smaller regressions discovered and fixed pre-release.
- DX/Infra: Clearer deployment pipeline; trace artifacts for failure analysis.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Flaky E2E tests → Mitigation: Stabilize with retries, proper waits, and tracing.
- Risk: Monitoring overhead → Mitigation: Sampled rates; disable in dev/test.
- Risk: DB migration errors → Mitigation: Dry runs, backups, and rollback scripts.

## Rollout Plan
1. CI Setup: Add workflows for lint/types/unit/component; cache deps.
2. E2E: Configure Playwright with trace-on-failure; stabilize core paths.
3. Monitoring: Integrate SDK; set sampling; redact PII; add dashboards.
4. Performance: Run Lighthouse/CWV; fix high-impact issues; recheck.
5. Database: Add migration scripts, error handling; evaluate pooling post-load test.

## Migration Steps Checklist
- [ ] CI workflows created and green for core branches.
- [ ] Playwright runs with trace artifacts on failure.
- [ ] Monitoring SDK integrated with env-driven config.
- [ ] Lighthouse/CWV baseline captured and improvements documented.
- [ ] DB migrations and error handling patterns established.

## Success Metrics
- CI gate success rate ~100%; median build < N minutes.
- CWV passes on target pages; no major animation leaks.
- Error rates within agreed SLO; actionable dashboards in place.
- DB migrations run cleanly with rollback tested.

## Backout Plan
- Temporarily disable stricter CI gates if blocking hotfixes; restore later.
- Feature-flag monitoring; roll back SDK quickly if issues arise.
- Roll back DB migrations using prepared scripts and backups.

## Follow-ups
- Add canary release process and on-call runbooks.
- Expand CI to include bundle budget checks and accessibility tests.
